# VQE_for_J1J2

Finding the ground state of the J1-J2 model, using VQE algorithm


## Notes:
Implemented the Feulner Hartmann ansatz for J1-J2 systems
it is hardcoded for 3x3 systems. it is quite complicated to do it for an arbitrary system, but it should be possible.
It should also be easier to do it for a 4x3 or 4x4 system.
